# Bus Mall

- It's a webpage that contains randomly generated pictures without any repeat.

- There will be 3 images in one line and they will change after clicking on any of them 

- Each image has two counters, the first for how many times it was clicked on (how many times it has been chosen), the second will count how many times it has been shown.

- And there will  be a button to show the results in a list.
- And a bar chart , that will be shown after getting the results.

- The results will be saved in local storage.
